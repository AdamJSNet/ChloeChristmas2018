# Chloe Christmas 2018
**v1.0.0**

Made for Chloe to try to guess her Christmas present,
which still hadn't arrived in the post by Christmas Eve.

Built using the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)
~~for "rapid prototyping"~~ because it was Christmas Eve.

`node_modules` directory has been `.gitignored`, because good practice/habit -
so run `npm install` before `ask deploy`
